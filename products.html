        <h2>Evangelion Unit-01</h2>

        <div class="details"><h2>Product Details:</h2></div>

        <p>Evangelion Unit-01 is, like all Evangelions, a giant artificial human (Jinzo ningen?) with brown skin. It has a mouth similar to that of a human as well as two round green eyes. The face also has four small nostrils and red blood. Its true appearance is concealed under armor, called Type-B Gear, also serving to limit its real strength. The Unit-01 armor is a prototype model, and therefore different from the following models. </p>

        <h2>Evangelion Unit-02</h2>

        <div class="details"><h2>Product Details:</h2></div>

        <p>Unit-02 is a Production Model Evangelion and uses the same armor arrangement as the succeeding Unit-03 and Unit-04, along with the upgraded Unit-00'. All Evangelion using this arrangement have the same shoulder pylon design and five V-shaped armor plates on their torso.</p>

        <h2>Evangelion Unit-03</h2>

        <div class="details"><h2>Product Details:</h2></div>

        <p>A few minor changes were made between the first and second Production Models. Unit-03's color was unique, with much darker plates than any other Evangelion. The head was oddly shaped, too, with a rounded top and exaggerated chin. Unit-03 sports a predominately black color scheme with white and red highlights.</p>
